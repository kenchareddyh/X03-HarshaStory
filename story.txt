Jhonny was stuck in the library on a friday night doing his CS project that he
put off for 2 whole weeks. As he sat there scrolling through his notes his 
phone buzzed. Jhonny opened up his phone and saw that he had gotten a text 
from an unkown number. Suddenly he dropped his phone and ran out of the room.

However, his phone was N*te 7 of a famous brand, a weapon of mass destruction.
Although it just looked like a small phone, its power can destroy a whole
city. And, it was very unstable. Even if you treated it gently, it might still
exploded, not to mention a hard hit on the ground. BOOOOOM!!! Within a few 
second, the whole city was totally destroyed.

Everyone blamed Jhonny for this, he was shunned by everyone and soon Jhonny became very 
depressed. He took a bunch of anti-depressants but he still felt sad and empty. Soon
Jhonny took up a skill of being a writer. Jhonny then realized how much he hated doing
CS and switched his major into being a linguistic analysis of gender major.

The city was metaphorically destroyed. It was not a firey act of destruction
or anything similar to that, instead his phone unleased Coronavirus to the 
city. The local university that was in the town shut down and all of its
residents were forced to evacuate. All underclassmen were ordered to turn
their keys into the desk and leave with 4 days notice...

Now came Tony, the first living thing in the universe. He was a brave fighter. He used his magic
to eliminate virus and bring those dead alive. He shoot at Jhonny and said
"I hope no bugs in the heaven."Then Jhonny died. "I would award those who can code without bugs,"
the superman said.
