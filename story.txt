Jhonny was stuck in the library on a friday night doing his CS project that he
put off for 2 whole weeks. As he sat there scrolling through his notes his 
phone buzzed. Jhonny opened up his phone and saw that he had gotten a text 
from an unkown number. Suddenly he dropped his phone and ran out of the room.
